Employers increasingly use social media tools such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn (rather than, say, as many employment agencies) to recruit new employees. Employers use new mobile applications, for instance, to monitor employee location and to provide digital photos at the facility clock-in location to identify workers. The feedback, fun, and objectives inherent in gaming support many new training applications, and Web sites such as Knack, Gild, and True Office enable employers to inject gaming features into training, performance appraisal, and recruiting. Cloud computing and more intuitive user interfaces enable employers to monitor and report on things like a team's goal attainment and to provide real-time evaluative feedback. Finally, data analytics basically means using statistical techniques, algorithms, and problem-solving to identify relationships among data for the purpose of solving particular problems (such as what are the ideal candidate's traits, or how can I tell in advance which of my best employees is likely to quit?) When applied to human resource management, data analytics is called talent analytics.",

                "answer": "Today, in more and more companies like Uber, Elance, and Airbnb, employees aren't employees at all. They are what are called on-demand workers, or freelancers and independent contractors who work when they can on what they want to work on when the company needs them. So, for example, Airbnb can run, in essence, a vast lodging company with only a fraction of the \"regular\" employees Hilton Worldwide or another hotel chain would need, as the lodgings are managed by the homeowners themselves. Other sites tapping on-demand workers include Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Elance-oDesk, TaskRabbit, and Handybook (which lets users tap Handy's thousands of freelance cleaners and furniture assemblers when they need jobs done). These short-term professionals can be viewed as \"mobile, independent bundles of skills.\" Employers' increasing reliance on such Uber-like \"extended workforces\" has implications for HR. Companies that rely on freelancers, consultants, and other such nontraditional employees will need to create personnel policies on matters like compensation for these \"nonemployees\" and become more expert as talent brokers in matching specific workers with specific tasks that need to be done.",

                "question": "How has increasing globalization affected business?",
                "answer": "Globalization has impacted how and where companies do business. Free trade areas??? agreements that reduce tariffs and barriers among trading partners???encourage international trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) are examples. Globalization has boomed for the past 50 or so years. For example, the total sum of U.S. imports and exports rose from $47 billion in 1960, to $562 billion in 1980, to about $5.1 trillion recently. Changing economic and political philosophies drove this boom. Governments dropped cross-border taxes or tariffs, formed economic free trade areas, and took other steps to encourage the free flow of trade among countries. The fundamental economic rationale was that by doing so, all countries would gain, and indeed, economies around the world did grow quickly until recently. At the same time, globalization vastly increased international competition. More globalization meant more competition, and more competition meant more pressure to be \"world class\"???to lower costs, to make employees more productive, and to do things better and less expensively. As multinational companies jockey for position, many transfer operations abroad, not just to seek cheaper labor but to tap into new markets. For example, Toyota has thousands of sales employees based in America, while GE has over 10,000 employees in France. The search for greater efficiencies prompts some employers to offshore (export jobs to lower-cost locations abroad, as when Dell offshored some call-center jobs to India). Some employers offshore even highly skilled jobs such as lawyer. Managing the \"people\" aspects of globalization is a big task for any company that expands abroad???and for its HR managers.",

Title VII also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to administer and enforce the Civil Rights law at work. The changes brought about by Title VII as well as demographic changes and globalization have altered the modern workforce. White males no longer dominate the labor force, and women and minorities represent the lion's share of labor force growth over the near future. Furthermore, globalization requires employers to hire minority members with the appropriate cultural and language competencies to deal with customers abroad. Managing diversity means maximizing diversity's potential benefits (greater cultural awareness, and broader language competencies, for instance) while minimizing the potential barriers (such as prejudices and bias) that can undermine the company's performance. Legally, compulsory actions can reduce some blatant diversity barriers; taking a diverse workforce and blending it into a close-knit and productive one requires more.",

Sexual harassment can also be proven if a hostile work environment is created by the sexual conduct of supervisors, co-workers, or nonemployees.",

Reasonable care can be shown through strong sexual harassment policies, training managers and employees regarding their responsibilities for complying with these policies, instituting reporting processes, investigating charges promptly, and taking corrective action promptly. Second, the employer can demonstrate that the plaintiff \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.\" The employee's failing to use formal organizational reporting systems satisfies the second component. When defending against discriminatory practice allegations, an employer can claim that the employment practice is a bona fide occupational qualification for performing the job.

Managers need to understand the questions that can and cannot be asked when interviewing applicants, and know what constitutes sexual harassment, and how equal employment opportunity law affects all human resources decisions, including those relating to appraisal, compensation, promotions, disciplinary procedures, and employee dismissals. First, managers should understand the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which states it is unlawful to discriminate in pay on the basis of sex when jobs involve equal work; require equivalent skills, effort, and responsibility; and are performed under similar working conditions.

These goals, in turn, should be guiding what everyone does. Management creates a hierarchy or chain of departmental goals, from the top down to the lowest-ranked managers, and even employees. Then, if everyone does his or her job???if each salesperson sells his or her quota, and the sales manager hires enough good salespeople, and the HR manager creates the right incentive plan, and the purchasing head buys enough raw materials???the company and the CEO should also accomplish the overall, company-wide strategic goals. You could therefore say with great certainty that without a clear plan at the top, no one in the company would have the foggiest notion of what to do. At best, you'd all be working at cross- purposes.",

                "answer": "Strategic management is the process of identifying and executing the organization's mission, by matching the organization's capabilities with the demands of its environment. The steps are as follows: Step 1: Where are we now as a business????Here the manager defines the company's current business and mission. Specifically, what products do we sell, where do we sell them, and how do our products or services differ from our competitors'? Step 2: The second step is to ask, \"Are we in the right business given our strengths and weaknesses and the challenges that we face?\" To answer this, managers \"audit\" or study both the firm's environment and the firm's internal strengths and weaknesses. Prudent managers periodically assess what's happening in their environments. You need to audit the firm's environment and strengths and weaknesses. You can use the environmental scanning worksheet or the SWOT chart. Step 3: Decide what our new business should be in terms of what we sell, where we will sell it, and how our products or services differ from competitors' products and services. This step is where vision statements and mission statements are developed. Step 4: Translate the desired new direction into strategic goals. At Ford, for example, what exactly did making \"Quality Job One\" mean for each department in terms of how they would boost quality? The answer was laid out in goals such as \"no more than 1 initial defect per 10,000 cars.\" Step 5: The manager chooses strategies???courses of action???that will enable the company to achieve its strategic goals. For example, how should Ford pursue its goal of no more than 1 initial defect per 10,000 cars? Perhaps open two new high-tech plants and put in place new, rigorous employee selection, training, and performance-appraisal procedures. Step 6: Strategy execution, which means translating the strategies created into action. This means actually hiring (or firing) people, building (or closing) plants, and adding (or eliminating) products and product lines. Step 7: The manager evaluates the results of his or her planning and execution. Things don't always turn out as planned. All managers should periodically assess the progress of strategic decisions.",

Sweet Leaf Tea recently received multi-million dollar investments which will enable the business to expand its national presence.

Corporate-level strategy identifies the portfolio of businesses that comprise the company and the ways in which these businesses relate to each other. The business-level strategy is the next level. It identifies how to build and strengthen the business's long-term competitive position in the marketplace. The lowest level is the functional-level strategies. Functional strategies identify the basic course of action that each department will pursue in order to help the business attain its competitive goals. HR strategies are a type of functional strategy. Every company needs its human resource management policies and activities to make sense in terms of its broad strategic aims. Strategic human resource management means formulating and executing human resource policies and practices that produce the employee competencies and behaviors the company needs to achieve its strategic aims. The basic idea behind strategic human resource management is simple: In formulating human resource management policies and activities, the manager's aim must be to produce the employee skills and behaviors that the company needs to achieve its strategic aims. Management formulates a strategic plan. That strategic plan implies certain workforce requirements. Given these workforce requirements, human resource management formulates HR strategies (policies and practices) to produce the desired workforce skills, competencies, and behaviors. Finally, the human resource manager identifies the measures he or she can use to gauge the extent to which its new policies and practices are actually producing the required employee skills and behaviors.",

The differential advantage becomes the source of competitive advantage. Target follows a differentiation strategy by stressing the sale of more upscale brands than Walmart.

                "answer": "Data analytics means using statistical and mathematical analysis and algorithms to find relationships and make predictions. For example, when online bookstores use algorithms to predict which books you're most likely to buy based on things like what books you've already bought and similarities between you and other groups, they are using data analytics. Data mining is crucial for data analytics and is \"the set of activities used to find new, hidden, or unexpected patterns in data.\" Data mining sifts through huge amounts of employee data to identify correlations that employers then use to improve their employee-selection and other practices. Thanks to data mining, the manager can discover patterns that he or she can then use to make predictions. Big data is basically data analytics on steroids, using very large data sets. The basic idea (of scientifically analyzing data to find relationships and make predictions) is the same. However, with \"big data\" the volume, velocity, and variety of data that are analyzed are much greater. In terms of volume, for example, Walmart now collects about 2.5 petabytes of data???2.5 million gigabytes???every hour from its customer transactions. Similarly, in terms of velocity, all these data are being created more or less instantaneously (as at Walmart); that means companies can use them to more quickly to adapt in real time (for instance, to who's buying what products, and therefore how to adjust online promotions). Finally, big data capitalizes on the huge variety of data now available. For instance, data come not just from Walmart's transactions but from customers' mobile phones, GPS, and social networks too.",

A high-performance work system is what managers now expect from the HR system. It means that the HR system is designed to maximize the overall quality of human capital throughout the organization. Based on ongoing research, firms that use HPWS practices perform at a significantly higher level than those that do not. Strategic human resource management is significant to a high-performance work system. Strategic human resource management refers to formulating and executing human resource policies and practices that produce the employee competencies and behaviors the company needs to achieve its strategic aims and to maximize its human resources. In formulating human resource management policies and activities, the manager's aim must be to produce the employee skills and behaviors that the company needs to achieve its strategic aims. For HPWSs, that most likely means implementing policies and practices regarding selection tests, training, merit increases, and incentive pay.",

Metrics might include, \"quality of new hires\" and on \"which recruitment sources produce the most new hires.\" Applicant tracking systems support the employer's talent management efforts in other ways. For example, installing an Authoria ATS enabled the Thomson Reuters Company to identify the sources, candidate traits, and best practices that work best in each geographic area where they do business. This in turn enabled them to reduce recruiting costs, for instance, by shifting recruitment dollars from less effective sources to ones that are more effective. Similarly, the ATS can also help hire better employees, for instance, by helping the employer see which employee competencies correlate with superior performance.",

This information helps management decide what sort of people to recruit and hire. Job analysis information is also crucial for estimating the value of each job and its appropriate compensation. A performance appraisal compares each employee's actual performance with his or her performance standards. Managers use job analysis to determine the job's specific activities and performance standards. Job analysis interviews are one of the most commonly used methods for gathering job analysis data. They range from completely unstructured interviews to highly structured ones containing hundreds of specific items to check off. Managers may conduct individual interviews with each employee, group interviews with groups of employees who have the same job, and/or supervisor interviews with one or more supervisors who know the job.",

Step 2: Review Relevant Background Information about the Job, Such as Organization Charts and Process Charts. Step 3: Select Representative Positions. Step 4: Actually Analyze the Job. Step 5: Verify the Job Analysis Information with the Worker Performing the Job and with His or Her Immediate Supervisor. Step 6: Develop a Job Description and Job Specification. There are various ways (interviews or questionnaires, for instance) to collect information on a job's duties, responsibilities, and activities. In practice, you could use any one of them, or combine several. The basic rule is to use those that best fit your purpose. Thus, an interview might be best for creating a list of job duties and job descriptions. The more quantitative position analysis questionnaire may be best for quantifying each job's relative worth for pay purposes. Interviews, questionnaires, observations, and diary/logs are the most popular methods for gathering job analysis data. They all provide realistic information about what job incumbents actually do.",

Job rotation means systematically moving workers from one job to another. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg argued that the best way to motivate workers is through job enrichment. Job enrichment means redesigning jobs in a way that increases the opportunities for the worker to experience feelings of responsibility, achievement, growth, and recognition. It does this by empowering the worker??? for instance, by giving the worker the skills and authority to inspect the work, instead of having supervisors do that. Herzberg said empowered employees would do their jobs well because they wanted to, and quality and productivity would rise.",

You use this information to write a job specification; this lists the knowledge, abilities, and skills required to perform the job satisfactorily. There is no standard format for writing a job description. However, most descriptions contain sections that cover: 1. Job identification 2. Job summary 3. Responsibilities and duties 4. Authority of incumbent 5. Standards of performance 6. Working conditions 7. Job specifications The job specification takes the job description and answers the question, \"What human traits and experience are required to do this job effectively?\" It shows what kind of person to recruit and for what qualities you should test that person.

                "answer": "Most job specifications come from the educated guesses of people like supervisors and human resource managers. The basic procedure here is to ask, \"What does it take in terms of education, intelligence, training, and the like to do this job well?\" There are several ways to get these \"educated guesses.\" You could simply review the job's duties and deduce from those what human traits and skills the job requires. You can also choose them from the competencies listed in Web-based job descriptions. In any case, use common sense when compiling your list. Don't ignore the behaviors that may apply to almost any job but that might not normally surface through a job analysis. Industriousness is an example. Who wants an employee who doesn't work hard? The other option is to base job specifications on statistical analysis, which is more defensible but also more difficult. The aim here is to determine statistically the relationship between (1) some predictor (human trait, such as height, intelligence, or finger dexterity), and (2) some indicator or criterion of job effectiveness, such as performance as rated by the supervisor. The procedure has five steps: (1) analyze the job and decide how to measure job performance; (2) select personal traits like finger dexterity that you believe should predict successful performance; (3) test candidates for these traits; (4) measure these candidates' subsequent job performance; and (5) statistically analyze the relationship between the human trait (finger dexterity) and job performance. Your objective is to determine whether the former predicts the latter. This method is more defensible than the judgmental approach because equal rights legislation forbids using traits that you can't prove distinguish between high and low job performers.",

To determine what a job's required competencies are, you should ask, \"In order to perform this job competently, what should the employee be able to do?\" We can say that competency-based job analysis means describing the job in terms of measurable, observable, behavioral competencies (knowledge, skills, and/or behaviors) that an employee doing that job must exhibit to do the job well. Competency-based job descriptions are beneficial to firms that are striving to be high- performance work systems. Here the whole thrust is to encourage employees to work in a self- motivated way. Employers do this by empowering employees, organizing the work around teams, encouraging team members to rotate freely among jobs, and pushing more responsibility for things like day-to-day supervision down to the workers.",

                "answer": "Filling open positions with inside candidates has several advantages. First, there is really no substitute for knowing a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, as you should after working with them for some time. Current employees may also be more committed to the company. Morale may rise if employees see promotions as rewards for loyalty and competency. And inside candidates should require less orientation and (perhaps) training than outsiders. However, hiring from within can also backfire. Employees who apply for jobs and don't get them may become discontented; telling them why you rejected them and what remedial actions they might take is crucial. When all managers come up through the ranks, they may have a tendency to maintain the status quo when a new direction is required. Internet recruiting is a cost-effective way to publicize openings; it generates more responses quicker and for a longer time at less cost than just about any other method. Internet recruiting has two big potential problems??? discrimination and overload. First, fewer older people use the Internet, so online application gathering may inadvertently exclude disproportionate numbers of older applicants (and certain minorities).

Retained recruiters are paid whether or not the employer eventually hires the executive through the efforts of the search firm. These recruiters tend to focus on executive positions paying $150,000 or more. Contingency- based recruiters tend to handle junior to middle level management job searches in the $50,000- $150,000 range. Recruiters bring a lot to the table. They have many contacts and are especially adept at finding qualified employed candidates who aren't actively looking to change jobs. They can keep your firm's name confidential until late into the search process. The recruiter can save top management's time by finding and screening an applicant pool. The recruiter's fee might actually turn out to be small when you compare it to the executive time saved.",

                "answer": "Effective recruiting is difficult for many employers because some recruiting methods are superior to others, depending on the type of job for which you are recruiting. Second, the success you have recruiting depends greatly on nonrecruitment issues and policies. For example, paying 10% more than most firms in your locale should, other things being equal, help you build a bigger applicant pool faster. Third, employment law prescribes what you can and cannot do when recruiting. For example, managers can't rely on word-of-mouth dissemination of information about job opportunities when the workforce is substantially all white or all members of some other class, such as Hispanic. In order for businesses to effectively recruit a more diverse workforce, they should take the goal of recruiting more minorities seriously, and pursue that goal energetically. In practice, this requires a three-part effort: Understand the recruitment barriers that prevent minorities from applying, formulate the required recruitment plans for attracting and retaining minorities and women, and institute the specific day-to-day programs into recruitment programs.",

Since fewer older people use the Internet, online application gathering may inadvertently exclude disproportionate numbers of older applicants and certain minorities. To prove they've complied with EEO laws, employers should keep track of each applicant's race, sex, and ethnic group. The EEO says that, to be an \"applicant,\" he or she must meet three conditions: he or she must express interest in employment; the employer must have taken steps to fill a specific job; and the individual must have followed the employer's standard application procedure. Firms must adhere to EEO laws in regards to the information they request on job application forms. For example, firms should remember that questions about an applicant's education should avoid asking about the dates of attendance and graduation from various schools because the information may reflect the applicant's age. The courts have usually held that employers violate Title VII by disqualifying applicants from employment because of an arrest, so forms should not ask about an applicant's arrest record. Some forms ask the applicant to list memberships in clubs, organizations, or societies. Employers should include instructions not to include organizations that would reveal race, religion, physical handicaps, marital status, or ancestry. It is usually illegal to require the listing of an applicant's physical handicaps or past illnesses unless the application blank specifically asks only for those that \"may interfere with your job performance.\"",

Demonstrating content validity sounds easier than it is in practice. Demonstrating that (1) the tasks the person performs on the test are really a comprehensive and random sample of the tasks performed on the job and (2) the conditions under which the person takes the test resemble the work situation is not always easy.

                "answer": "Cognitive tests are tests of general intellectual abilities. They measure not a single trait but rather a range of abilities, including memory, vocabulary, verbal fluency, and numerical ability. Psychologists often call such tests aptitude tests, since they purport to measure aptitude for the job in question. Consider the Test of Mechanical Comprehension which tests applicants' understanding of basic mechanical principles. This may reflect a person's aptitude for jobs???like that of machinist or engineer???that require mechanical comprehension. The work sampling technique tries to predict job performance by requiring job candidates to perform one or more samples of the job's basic tasks. Work sampling has several advantages. It measures actual job tasks, so it's harder to fake answers. The work sample's content???the actual tasks the person must perform??? is not as likely to be unfair to minorities. Designed properly, work samples exhibit better validity than do other tests designed to predict performance.",

                "answer": "A person's cognitive and physical abilities alone seldom explain his or her job performance. Other factors, like motivation and interpersonal skills, are very important, and these can be discovered through personality tests. Employers use personality tests to measure and predict intangibles of an applicant's personality, such as introversion, stability, and motivation. Situational tests require examinees to respond to situations representative of the job. Work sampling, video-based tests, and miniature job training are situational tests. Miniature job training and evaluation assumes that a person who demonstrates that he or she can learn and perform the sample of tasks will be able to learn and perform the job itself. This approach tests applicants with actual samples of the job, so it's inherently content relevant and valid.",

                "answer": "The \"big five\" personality dimensions are neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Neuroticism refers to a tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative effects like anxiety and insecurity. Extroversion represents a tendency to be sociable, assertive, and active. Openness to experience is the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. Agreeableness is the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. Conscientiousness is comprised of two related facets including achievement and dependability. Extroversion is generally associated with success in sales. Extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience are strong predictors of leadership. Neuroticism is negatively related to motivation. Conscientiousness is the most consistent and universal predictor of job performance.",

                "answer": "First, projective tests are hard to interpret. An expert must analyze the test taker's interpretations and infer from them his or her personality. The test's usefulness then assumes there's a measurable relationship between a personality trait (like introversion) and success on the job. Second, personality tests can trigger legal challenges. For example, one court held that the MMPI is a medical test (because it can screen out applicants with psychological impairments), and so might violate the ADA. Third, some experts dispute that self-report personality tests predict performance at all. Fourth, people can and will fake responses to personality tests. So personality tests can be useful tools but there can be significant concerns about use.",

In addition, employers should ensure that the interview process is structured and consistently applied. The interview should have objective, job-related questions and be administered in a standardized format. There should be multiple interviewers. Employers can also reassure candidates that the job interview process is fair, treat the interviewees with respect, and be willing to explain the process and the rationale for the interview questions. Testers are used to determine whether or not employment discrimination is occurring at a specific business. They make nondiscriminatory interviewing practices even more important to employers. As defined by the EEOC, testers are \"individuals who apply for employment which they do not intend to accept, for the sole purpose of uncovering unlawful discriminatory hiring practices.\" Although they're not really seeking employment, testers have legal standing with the courts and with the EEOC.",

The employer's point person would discuss the offer's main parameters, for instance in terms of pay rates, benefits, and actual job duties. There may be some negotiations. Once an agreement is reached, the employer would extend a written job offer to the candidate. There are several issues to consider with the written offer. In the job offer letter, the employer lists the offer's basic information. This typically starts with a welcome sentence. It then includes job specific information (such as details on salary and pay), benefits information, paid leave information, and terms of employment (including, for instance, successful completion of job testing and physical exams). There should be a strong statement that the employment relationship is \"at will.\" There is then a closing statement. This again welcomes the employee, mention who the employer's point person should be if any questions arise, and instruct the candidate to sign the letter of offer if it is acceptable. It is prudent to have an attorney review the offer before extending it.",

In the second, instructional design step, you formulate specific, measurable knowledge and performance training objectives, review possible training program content (including workbooks, exercises, and activities), and estimate a budget for the training program. The third step is to implement the program, by actually training the targeted employee group using methods such as on-the-job or online training. Finally, in an evaluation step, you assess the program's success. There are five suggestions for making training material more meaningful for employees. First, an overall picture of the training material that will be presented should be provided at the start of training. Second, familiar examples should be used. Third, the information should be logically organized and presented. Fourth, the vocabulary used during training should be familiar to the trainees. Fifth, many visual aids should be used.",

                "answer": "Task analysis is a detailed study of the job to determine what specific skills???like Java (in the case of a Web developer) or interviewing (in the case of a supervisor)???the job requires. Job descriptions and job specifications are important here. These list the job's specific duties and skills, which are the basic reference points in determining the training required. For under- performing current employees, you can't assume that training is the problem: Is it lack of training, or something else? Performance analysis is the process of verifying that there is a performance deficiency and determining whether the employer should correct such deficiencies through training or some other means (like transferring the employee). The first step in performance analysis is usually to compare the person's actual performance to what it should be. Doing so helps to confirm that there is a performance deficiency and may also help the manager to identify its cause.",

The types of on-the-job training include the coaching or understudy method, the job rotation method, and the special assignments method. Using the understudy method, an experienced worker or the trainee's supervisor trains the employee. At lower levels, the trainee might observe the supervisor, but it is also used at higher levels. Job rotation means that an employee moves from job to job at planned intervals. This is common in management training programs. Special assignments give employees firsthand experience in working on actual problems.",

                "answer": "Computer-based training refers to training methods that use interactive computer-based systems to increase knowledge or skills. For example, employers use CBT to teach employees safe methods for avoiding falls. The system lets trainees replay the lessons and answer questions, and is especially effective when paired with actual practice under a trainer's watchful eye. Computer-based training is increasingly realistic. For example, interactive multimedia training integrates the use of text, video, graphics, photos, animation, and sound to create a complex training environment with which the trainee interacts. In training a physician, for instance, such a system lets a medical student take a hypothetical patient's medical history, conduct an examination, and analyze lab tests. The student can then interpret the sounds and draw conclusions for a diagnosis. Virtual reality training takes this realism a step further, by putting trainees into a simulated environment.",

                "answer": "Programmed learning is a step-by-step self-learning method using a medium such as a textbook, computer, or the Internet. The three parts of the method include presenting questions, facts, and problems to the learner, allowing the person to respond, and then providing feedback on the accuracy of answers. Programmed learning reduces training time. It also facilitates learning by letting trainees learn at their own pace, get immediate feedback, and reduce their risk of error. Some argue that trainees do not learn much more from programmed learning than from a textbook. Yet studies generally support programmed learning's effectiveness. In addition to the usual programmed learning, computerized intelligent tutoring systems learn what questions and approaches worked and did not work for the learner, and then adjust the instructional sequence to the trainee's unique needs.",

However, strategic, cultural, structural, and technological changes will fail without the employees' active support. Organizational change therefore invariably involves bringing about changes in the employees themselves and in their attitudes, skills, and behaviors. Unfortunately, getting that active support (or at least silent compliance) from your employees is easier said than done. The manager invariably runs into employee resistance. Knowing how to deal with that resistance is the heart of implementing an organizational change program. Organizational development is a change process through which employees formulate the change that's required and implement it, often with the assistance of trained consultants.",

Because of the anchors, which are based on the dimensions of performance illustrated by critical incidents, a BARS combines the benefits of narratives, critical incident, and quantified scales. There are five steps required for developing a BARS. Each step is explained below. ??? Step 1: Write critical incidents. In this step, people who know the job are asked to describe specific illustrations of effective and ineffective performance. ??? Step 2: Develop performance dimensions. The people who know the job are then asked to cluster the incidents into a smaller set of performance dimensions and to define each dimension with a name. ??? Step 3: Reallocate incidents. Another group of people, who also know the job, should reallocate the original critical incidents. They will receive the cluster definitions and the list of critical incidents. They will then reassign each incident into the cluster they think it fits best. If the assignments made by the first group and second group match well, then that critical incident is retained. ??? Step 4: Scale the incidents. The second group then rates the behavior described by the incident as to how effectively or ineffectively it represents performance on the dimension. ??? Step 5: Develop a final instrument. Six or seven of the incidents are the dimension's behavioral anchors.",

Second, using the right appraisal tool for each situation is important. Third, supervisors can keep a diary of critical incidents to file and use for later reference for subordinate's appraisals. This technique helps to ensure that both negative and positive incidents are recorded. Fourth, make sure that the primary goal of the appraisal is to improve unsatisfactory performance or reinforce exemplary performance. Finally, the appraisal should be fair. Many employers use rating committees. These committees usually contain the employee's immediate supervisor and two or three other supervisors. Using multiple raters makes sense. Although there may be discrepancies among ratings by individual supervisors, the composite ratings tend to be more reliable, fair, and valid. Using several raters can also help cancel out problems like bias and halo effects.",

It is important to communicate performance standards to employees and supervisors in writing and avoid abstract trait names when using graphic rating scales. Steps to ensure the appraisal are legally defensible are these: Base the performance appraisal criteria on a job analysis. At the start of the period, communicate performance standards to employee in writing. Using a single overall rating of performance is not acceptable to the courts. Include an employee appeals process. One appraiser should never have absolute authority to determine a person's actions. Document all information bearing on a personnel decision in writing.

Second, appraisals play a central role in the employer's performance management process. Third, it lets the manager and subordinate develop a plan for correcting any deficiencies that might exist and to reinforce and support things that are done well. Fourth, appraisals can serve a useful career planning purpose by providing the opportunity to review the employee's career plans in light of his or her strengths and weaknesses. When a supervisor tells someone his or her performance is poor, the first reaction is often denial. Denial is a defense mechanism. Understanding and dealing with defensiveness is an important appraisal skill. A supervisor should recognize that defensive behavior is normal and never attack a person's defenses. A supervisor should postpone action because given sufficient time, a more rational reaction may take over. A supervisor should not try to be a psychologist. Offering understanding is one thing; trying to deal with psychological problems is another.",

Answer: RAISE PAY The most obvious explanation for why employees quit is often also the correct one: low pay. Particularly for high performers and key employees, enhanced pay has recently been the retention tool of choice for many employers. HIRE SMART \"Retention starts up front, with the selection and hiring of the right employees.\" This refers not just to the worker but also to hiring the right supervisors. For example, FedEx conducts periodic employee attitude surveys. The supervisor then meets to review the results with his or her employees to address any leadership problems the surveys raise. DISCUSS CAREERS One expert says, \"Professionals who feel their company cares about their development and progress are much more likely to stay.\" Periodically discuss with employees their career preferences and prospects, and help them lay out career plans. PROVIDE DIRECTION People can't do their jobs if they don't know what to do or what their goals are. Therefore, retaining employees requires making it clear what your expectations are regarding their performance and what their responsibilities are. OFFER FLEXIBILITY In one survey, workers identified \"flexible work arrangements\" and \"telecommuting\" as the two top benefits that would encourage them to choose one job over another. USE HIGH-PERFORMANCE HR PRACTICES In one study, call centers that made more use of high involvement work practices (for instance, employee empowerment, problem-solving groups, and self-directed teams) had lower rates of quitting, dismissals, and total turnover. So did those that \"invested\" more in employees (for instance, in terms of promotion opportunities, high relative pay, pensions, and full-time jobs). COUNTEROFFER? If a valued employee says he or she is leaving, should you make a counteroffer? Many argue against doing so, calling it a \"Band-Aid for a head wound.\" Employers who do allow counteroffers need a policy that specifies what people and positions are eligible for counteroffers, allowable compensation enhancements, and how to determine the offer.

HIRE SMART \"Retention starts up front, with the selection and hiring of the right employees.\" This refers not just to the worker but also to hiring the right supervisors. For example, FedEx conducts periodic employee attitude surveys. The supervisor then meets to review the results with his or her employees to address any leadership problems the surveys raise. DISCUSS CAREERS One expert says, \"Professionals who feel their company cares about their development and progress are much more likely to stay.\" Periodically discuss with employees their career preferences and prospects, and help them lay out career plans. PROVIDE DIRECTION People can't do their jobs if they don't know what to do or what their goals are. Therefore, retaining employees requires making it clear what your expectations are regarding their performance and what their responsibilities are. OFFER FLEXIBILITY In one survey, workers identified \"flexible work arrangements\" and \"telecommuting\" as the two top benefits that would encourage them to choose one job over another. USE HIGH-PERFORMANCE HR PRACTICES In one study, call centers that made more use of high involvement work practices (for instance, employee empowerment, problem-solving groups, and self-directed teams) had lower rates of quitting, dismissals, and total turnover. So did those that \"invested\" more in employees (for instance, in terms of promotion opportunities, high relative pay, pensions, and full-time jobs). COUNTEROFFER? If a valued employee says he or she is leaving, should you make a counteroffer? Many argue against doing so, calling it a \"Band-Aid for a head wound.\" Employers who do allow counteroffers need a policy that specifies what people and positions are eligible for counteroffers, allowable compensation enhancements, and how to determine the offer.",

A reasonable first step is to conduct numerical analyses of pending retirements. Employers seeking to recruit and/or retain retirees need to take several steps. The general idea is to institute human resource policies that encourage and support older workers. Other techniques employers use to keep older workers include offering them part-time positions, hiring them as consultants or temporary workers, offering them flexible work arrangements, encouraging them to work past traditional retirement age, providing training to upgrade skills, and instituting a phased retirement program. The latter lets senior workers ease into retirement with gradually reduced work schedules. Not surprisingly, studies show that employees who are more committed and loyal to the employer are more likely to stay beyond their normal retirement age.",

                "answer": "There are several steps companies can take to enhance the prospects for women. First, organizations should take the career interests of women employees seriously. They should identify institutional barriers and eliminate them. For instance, requiring late evening meetings disproportionately affects women. Unfortunately, many career development programs are not consistent with the needs of minority and nonminority women. For example, many such programs underestimate the role played by family responsibilities in many women's lives. Similarly, some programs assume that career paths are continuous; however, the need to stop working for a time to attend to family needs often punctuates the career paths of many people of color and women. Inflexible promotional ladders (such as \"You must work 8 years of 50-hour weeks to apply for partner\") can put women???who often have more responsibility for child- raising chores???at a disadvantage. One solution is to institute career tracks (including reduced hours and more flexible year-round work schedules) that enable women to periodically reduce their time at work, but remain on a partner track. Companies should improve the opportunities for networking and mentoring. They should eliminate the glass ceiling; though this is a difficult challenge. Finally, companies can institute flexible schedules to provide women the opportunity to meet their obligations at home and at work successfully.",

                "answer": "The first decision is whether to base promotions on seniority or competency or some combination of the two. A focus on competitiveness and motivation favors promotion based on competency. But when union or civil service regulations are involved, seniority may be favored. The second decision occurs if the firm chooses to base the promotional process on competency. If it does, the firm must then decide how to define and measure competency. Past performance is based on defining the job, setting standards, and appraising performance. For promotional purposes, the organization must decide whether this past performance is also predictive of a candidate's future performance. The third decision is whether the process is formal or informal. If the process is informal, employees may feel like one's personal network is more important than performance. Formal procedures include formal promotion policies that are distributed to all employees. They may also include a job-posting policy and the use of employee qualification briefs. The fourth decision is whether the promotion will be vertical or horizontal or something else. This may be an issue if a company is downsizing. Promotions can involve different types of positions aside from supervisory positions.",

Lack of qualifications for the job is an employee's inability to do the assigned work, although he or she is diligent. Because this employee may be trying to do the job, it is reasonable to try to salvage him or her???perhaps through further training or by assigning the employee to another job. Changed requirements of the job is an employee's incapability of doing the job after the nature of the job has changed.

The second direct payment option is to pay for performance. Piecework and sales commissions are examples of performance-based compensation. Developing compensation plans for managers or professionals is similar in many respects to developing plans for any employee. The basic aim is the same: to attract and keep good employees. Managerial jobs tend to stress harder to quantify factors like judgment and problem solving more than do production and clerical jobs. There is also more emphasis on paying managers and professionals based on results???based on their performance or on what they can do???rather than on the basis of static job demands like working conditions. So, job evaluation, although still important, usually plays a secondary role to non-salary issues like bonuses, incentives, market rates, and benefits.",

                "answer": "Employers have different ways of handling cost-of-living differentials. One is to give the transferred person a nonrecurring payment in a lump sum amount. Another is to pay a differential for ongoing costs in addition to a one-time allocation. Others simply raise the employee's base salary. For international transfers, companies can go with a home-based or host-based salary plan. With a home-based salary plan, an international transferee's base salary reflects his or her home country's salary. The employer then adds allowances for cost-of-living differences???housing and schooling costs, for instance. This is a reasonable approach for short-term assignments, and avoids the problem of having to change the employee's base salary every time he or she moves. In the host-based plan, the firm ties the international transferee's base salary to the host country's salary structure. In other words, the manager from New York who is sent to France would have his or her base salary changed to the prevailing base salary for that position in France, rather than keep the New York base salary. The firm usually tacks on cost-of-living, housing, schooling, and other allowances here as well. Most multinational enterprises set expatriates' salaries according to the home-based salary plan.",

The four forms are external, internal, individual, and procedural. External equity refers to how a job's pay rate in one company compares to the job's pay rate in other companies. Internal equity refers to how fair the job's pay rate is when compared to other jobs within the same company. Individual equity refers to the fairness of an individual's pay as compared with what his or her co-workers are earning for the same or very similar jobs within the company, based on each individual's performance.

In a brief essay, explain the point method of job evaluation and why it is problematic for firms in regards to comparable worth.",

It involves identifying (1) several compensable factors, each having several degrees, as well as (2) the degree to which each of these factors is present in the job. Assume there are five degrees of \"responsibility\" a job could contain. Further, assume you assign a different number of points to each degree of each factor. Once the evaluation committee determines the degree to which each compensable factor (like \"responsibility\" and \"effort\") is present in the job, it can calculate a total point value for the job by adding up the corresponding points for each factor. The result is a quantitative point rating for each job. Comparable worth has implications for job evaluation. Virtually every comparable worth case that reached a court involved the use of the point method of job evaluation. By assigning points to dissimilar jobs, point plans facilitate comparability ratings among different jobs. Perhaps the wisest approach is for employers to price their jobs as they see fit (with or without point plans), but to ensure that women have equal access to all jobs. In other words, eliminate the wage discrimination issue by eliminating sex-segregated jobs..",

The job evaluation is a formal and systematic comparison of jobs to determine the worth of one job relative to another. Job evaluation eventually results in a wage or salary structure or hierarchy (this shows the pay rate for various jobs or groups of jobs). The basic principle of job evaluation is this: Jobs that require greater qualifications, more responsibilities, and more complex job duties should receive more pay than jobs with lesser requirements. Many employers use job evaluation for pricing managerial jobs in most large firms. The basic approach is to classify all executive and management positions into a series of grades, each with a salary range. As with non-managerial jobs, one alternative is to rank the executive and management positions in relation to each other, grouping those of equal value.

                "answer": "For a CEO position, job evaluation typically has little relevance. One recent study concluded that three main factors: job complexity (span of control, the number of functional divisions over which the executive has direct responsibility, and management level), the employer's ability to pay (total profit and rate of return), and the executive's human capital (educational level, field of study, work experience) accounted for about two-thirds of executive compensation variance. There are various reasons why boards are clamping down on executive pay. The Dodd-Frank law of 2010 requires American companies give shareholders a \"say on pay.\" Law firms are filing class-action suits demanding information from companies about their senior executives' pay decisions. As of 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required filing more compensation-related information, including a detailed listing of all individual \"perks\" or benefits if they total more than $100,000. As of 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board required that most public companies recognize as an expense the fair value of the stock options they grant. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes executives personally liable, under certain conditions, for corporate financial oversight lapses.",

Pay ranges also let companies provide for performance differences between employees within the same grade or between those with different seniorities. Companies create broadbands for several reasons. The basic advantage is that it injects greater flexibility into employee assignments. It is especially sensible where firms organize into self-managing teams. However, broadbanding can be unsettling, particularly for new employees. \"There's a sense of permanence in the set of job responsibilities often attached to job titles,\" one manager says.

With competency-based pay (CBP), the supervisor certifies employee competency prior to any pay increases. With JBP, pay changes when one switches jobs. With CBP, one must demonstrate proficiency prior to getting a raise. Also, one could do a lower-paying job but still receive a higher pay based on skill. JBP systems may tie pay to grade or seniority. CBP pays for competencies, not seniority. There is more advancement possible with CBP plans than with JBP.

                "answer": "Vroom states that a person's motivation to exert some level of effort or specific behavior is a function of three things: valence, instrumentality, and expectancy. Valence is the perceived value the person attaches to the reward. Instrumentality is the perceived relationship between successful performance and obtaining the reward. Expectancy is the probability that performance of the behavior or exertion of the effort will result in achieving the desired reward. Motivation is equal to E * I * V. Victor Vroom would say there should be a clear link between effort and performance, and between performance and reward, and that the reward must be attractive to the employee.",

Piece rate plans appear equitable in principle, and in their incentive value, and are powerful since they tie pay directly to performance. Piecework also has disadvantages. The main one is its unsavory reputation among many employees based on some employers' habit of arbitrarily raising production standards whenever they found their workers earning \"excessive wages.\" A more subtle disadvantage is that since piece rate are quoted on a per piece basis, in workers' minds, production standards (pieces per hour) become tied inseparably to the amount of money earned. Piece rate systems thus risk engendering rigidity. When the employer tries to revise production standards, resistance ensures. Employees become preoccupied with producing the number of units needed. They can become less focused on quality and may resist switching jobs (since doing so could reduce productivity).",

For employees receiving traditional merit increases, raises in subsequent years are based on the new higher amount. With lump sum merit raises, payroll expenses can be minimized over time while still offering an incentive. Further, the lump sum amount may seem more impressive to employees because it is a large amount paid at one time. For instance, a lump sum merit payment of $1500 may seem more desirable than a traditional weekly merit payout of $29 for 52 weeks.",

                "answer": "There is a long list possible, such as: employee recognition, gift certificates, special events, cash rewards, merchandise incentives, e-mail/print communications, training programs, work/life benefits, variable pay, group travel, individual travel, sweepstakes, encouraging learning and continuous improvement, providing encouragement, giving compliments, allowing employees to set their own goals, expressing appreciation in front of others, sending a note of thanks, giving an employee-of-the-month award, providing a bigger or nicer desk or office. Research indicates that both the financial and nonfinancial incentives improve employee and store performance. The term recognition program usually refers to formal programs, such as employee-of-the-month programs. Social recognition programs generally refer to informal manager-employee exchanges such as praise, approval, or expression of appreciation for a job well done. Employers often supplement financial incentives with various non-financial and recognition based awards. Performance feedback means providing quantitative or qualitative information on task performance to change or maintain performance; showing workers a graph of how their performance is trending is an example.",

Short-term bonuses can easily result in plus or minus adjustments of 25% or more to total pay. Three factors influence one's bonus: eligibility, fund size, and individual performance. Gainsharing is an incentive plan that engages many or all employees in a common effort to achieve a company's productivity objectives, with any resulting cost-savings gains shared among employees and the company. Popular gainsharing plans include the Scanlon, Lincoln, Rucker, and Improshare plans. The basic difference among these plans is how employers determine employee bonuses. The Scanlon formula divides payroll expenses by total sales (or, sometimes, by total sales plus increases in inventory). In one version of the Lincoln incentive system, first instituted at the Lincoln Electric Company of Ohio, employees work on a guaranteed piecework basis. The company then distributes total annual profits (less taxes, 6% dividends to stockholders, and a reserve) each year among employees based on their merit rating. Most firms customize their gainsharing plans.",

Employees aren't taxed until they receive a distribution from the trust, usually at retirement when the tax rate is lower. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act allows a firm to borrow against employee stock held in trust and then repay the loan in pretax rather than after-tax dollars. ESOPs also help shareholders of closely held corporations to diversify their assets by placing some of their own shares of the company's stock into the ESOP trust and purchasing other marketable securities for themselves in their place. ESOPs also encourage employees to develop a sense of ownership in and commitment to the firm. They provide increased financial incentives, create a sense of ownership, and help to build teamwork.",

                "question": "Describe what a Scanlon Plan is and its 5 major elements.",
                "answer": "The Scanlon plan was developed in 1937 by Joseph Scanlon, a United Steel Workers Union official. Scanlon plans have five basic features. The first is Scanlon's philosophy of cooperation. This philosophy assumes that managers and workers must rid themselves of the \"us\" and \"them\" attitudes that normally inhibit employees from developing a sense of ownership in the company. A second feature is what its practitioners call identity. This means that in order to focus employee involvement, the company must articulate its mission or purpose, and employees must understand how the business operates in terms of customers, prices, and costs. Competence is a third basic feature. The program, say three experts, \"explicitly recognizes that a Scanlon plan demands a high level of competency from employees at all levels.\" This suggests careful selection and training. The fourth feature of the plan is the involvement system. Employees present improvement suggestions to the appropriate departmental-level committees, which transmit the valuable ones to the executive-level committee. It then decides whether to implement the suggestion. The fifth element of the plan is the sharing of benefits formula. If a suggestion is implemented and successful, all employees usually share in 75% of the savings. For example, assume that the normal monthly ratio of payroll costs to sales is 50%. (Thus, if sales are $600,000, payroll costs should be $300,000.) Assume the firm implements suggestions that result in payroll costs of $250,000 in a month when sales were $550,000 and payroll costs therefore should have been $275,000 (50% of sales). The savings attributable to these suggestions is $25,000 ($275,000 minus $250,000). Workers would typically split 75% of this ($18,750), while $6,250 would go to the firm. In practice, the firm sets aside about one-quarter of the $18,750, for months when payroll costs exceed the standard.",

Most sick leave policies grant full pay for a set number of sick days and the sick days accumulate over time.

Such absenteeism costs U.S. employers perhaps $100 billion per year, with personal illness accounting for about a third of the absences. Employers use several tactics to reduce excessive sick leave absence. Some repurchase unused sick leave at the end of the year by paying their employees a sum for each unused sick day. The problem is that legitimately sick employees may come to work. Others hold monthly lotteries in which only employees with perfect monthly attendance are eligible for a cash prize. At Marriott, employees can trade the value of some sick days for other benefits. Others aggressively investigate all absences, calling absent employees at home. Many employers use pooled paid leave plans (or \"banks\"). These plans lump together sick leave, vacation, and personal days into a single leave pool.",

For example, in most states counselors must disclose suspicions of child abuse to state agencies. Define the program's purpose, employee eligibility, the roles and responsibilities of EAP and employer personnel, and procedures for using the plan. Also, ensure the vendors you use fulfill professional and state licensing requirements. For employers, EAPs produce advantages, not just costs.

With respect to employee relations, experts generally define organizational justice in terms of at least two components???distributive justice and procedural justice. Distributive justice refers to the fairness and justice of the decision's result. Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the process. How you conduct appraisals is important in regards to fairness and organizational justice. Studies confirm that, in practice, some managers ignore accuracy in performance appraisals and instead use the process for political purposes. Few things can send a more damaging signal about how fair and ethical the company is. To send the signal that organizational justice exists, standards should be clear, employees should understand the basis upon which you're going to appraise them, the appraisal itself should be objective, and the employer should include ethics goals in appraisals of its leaders, particularly its senior leaders.",

                "answer": "Employers also use special teams to gain employees' involvement. Suggestion teams are temporary teams whose members work on specific analytical assignments, such as how to cut costs or raise productivity. One airline split employees (such as baggage handlers and ground crew) into separate teams, linking team members via its Web site for brainstorming and voting on ideas. Some employers go beyond suggestions teams and create problem-solving teams which formalize this process and make the teams semipermanent. These identify and research work processes and develop solutions to work-related problems. They usually consist of the supervisor and five to eight employees from a common work area. A quality circle is a type of formal problem-solving team, usually composed of 6 to 12 specially trained employees who meet weekly to solve problems affecting their work area. The team gets training in problem-analysis techniques (including basic statistics). Then it applies these techniques to solve problems in its work area. The last type is self-managing/self-directed work teams which are small (usually 8 to 10 members) groups of carefully selected, trained, and empowered employees who basically run themselves with little or no outside supervision, usually for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task or mission. The task or mission might be an auto dashboard installed or a fully processed insurance claim, but the main characteristic is that the one team is created to do the task and has significant autonomy in how they do so.",

Imbalance of Power: people who bully use their power to control or harm and the people being bullied may have a hard time defending themselves, ??? Intent to Cause Harm: actions done by accident are not bullying; the person bullying has a goal to cause harm, ??? Repetition: incidents of bullying happen to the same person over and over by the same person or group. Employers and HR departments must have systems in place to ensure that the company can identify unfair treatment and deal with it expeditiously. This includes having policies in place to monitor employees' use of social media Web sites, developing ethics codes, and establishing an organizational culture that does not tolerate bullying.",

Moral judgments also trigger strong emotions. Violating moral standards may therefore make someone feel ashamed or remorseful. The most powerful morality comes from within.

A value is a basic belief about what is right or wrong, or about what you should or shouldn't do. Values are important because they guide and channel behavior. Managing people and shaping their behavior therefore depends on shaping the values they use as behavioral guides. The firm's culture should therefore send clear signals about what is and isn't acceptable behavior.

PENALTIES A system of progressive penalties is the second pillar of effective discipline. The severity of the penalty usually depends on the offense and the number of times it has occurred. For example, most companies issue warnings for the first unexcused lateness. However, for a fourth offense, discharge is the usual disciplinary action. APPEALS PROCESS: An appeals process should be part of the disciplinary process. The aim here is to ensure that supervisors mete out discipline fairly.

A private discussion is also held with the employee but without any threats. If a third incident occurs, the employee is given a one-day leave with pay to consider whether this job is a good fit for him or her and whether he or she will commit to meeting the company's policies. The following day, the employee meets with his or her supervisor to discuss his or her decision to stay and follow the rules or leave.

                "question": "What are the major reasons why workers unionize? What are some of the benefits workers can potentially gain from unionizing?",
                "answer": "Pay and working conditions are important factors. Recent median weekly wage for union workers was $970, versus $763 for nonunion workers. Union workers also generally receive more holidays, sick leave, unpaid leave, insurance plan benefits, long-term disability benefits, and other benefits???about $14.50 per hour in benefits compared with about $7.50 per hour for nonunion workers. But it's not just money. The urge to unionize often comes down to the belief on the part of workers that it's only through unity that they can get their fair share of the \"pie\" and also protect themselves from the arbitrary whims of management. The bottom line is that low morale, fear of job loss, and poor communication (in other words, poor employee relations) also foster unionization. Modern Survey conducted a study that measured items such as employees' interest in being represented by a union, confidence in senior management, and employee engagement. It concluded that 50% of \"actively disengaged\" employees would vote \"yes\" to unionization, while only 20% of such employees would vote \"no union\". It concludes that \"paying attention to employee engagement levels within your organization helps to foster positive relationships between employees and management and decreases the likelihood of a workforce seeking union representation.\" Gallup conduct its own surveys that complements these conclusions. For example, among the over 500 organizations in which Gallup measures employee engagement, 45% of nonunion employees were engaged, while fewer???38%???of unionized employees were engaged.",

The five types of union security are closed shop, union shop, agency shop, preferential shop, and maintenance of membership agreement. In the closed shop form, the company can hire only union members. In the union shop form, the company can hire nonunion people, but those people must join the union after a prescribed period of time and pay dues. In the agency shop form, employees who do not belong to the union still must pay union dues on the assumption that the union's efforts benefit all the workers. In a preferential shop, union members are given hiring preference. In the final type, maintenance of membership agreement, employees do not have to belong to the union, but union members employed by the firm must maintain union membership for the period of their contract.",

                "answer": "Several things contributed to union membership decline over the past 60 or so years. Unions traditionally appealed mostly to blue-collar workers, and the proportion of blue-collar jobs has been decreasing as service-sector and white-collar service jobs have increased. Furthermore, several economic factors, including intense international competition, have put unions under further pressure. Globalization increases competition, and competition increases pressures on employers to cut costs and boost productivity. This in turns puts unions in a squeeze. Other factors pressuring employers and unions include the deregulation of trucking, airlines, and communications; outdated equipment and factories; mismanagement; new technology; and laws (such as Title VII) that somewhat substituted for and reduced the need for unions. The effect of all this has been the permanent layoff of hundreds of thousands of union members, the permanent closing of company plants, the relocation of companies to nonunion settings (either in the United States or abroad), and mergers and acquisitions that eliminated union jobs and affected collective bargaining agreements. Union membership as a percentage of people working has dropped about 2/3 over 50 years.",

                "answer": "Until about 1930, there were no special labor laws. Employers were not required to engage in collective bargaining with employees and were virtually unrestrained in their behavior toward unions; the use of spies and firing of union agitators were widespread. \"Yellow dog\" contracts, whereby management could require nonunion membership as a condition for employment, were widely enforced. Most union weapons???even strikes???were illegal. This one- sided situation lasted until the Great Depression (around 1930). The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 set the stage for a new era in which union activity was encouraged. It guaranteed to each employee the right to bargain collectively \"free from interference, restraint, or coercion.\" It limited the courts' abilities to issue injunctions (stop orders) for activities such as peaceful picketing and payment of strike benefits. In 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations (or Wagner) Act to add teeth to Norris-LaGuardia. It did this by (1) banning certain unfair labor practices, (2) providing for secret-ballot elections and majority rule for determining whether a firm's employees would unionize, and (3) creating the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to enforce these two provisions.",

Asleep at the switch???executives being unaware of important issues among the workforce and growing union sentiment among the workforce. ??? Appointing a committee???employer forming a committee to manage the union election campaign. The problems here are that (1) promptness is essential in an election situation and committees are slow (2) most committee members are NLRB neophytes, whose views reflect hope rather than experience (3) a committee's decision is usually a compromise decision, not necessarily the most effective one. ??? Concentrating on money and benefit???employees may want more money, but quite often, if they feel the company treats them fairly, decently, and honestly, they are satisfied with reasonable, competitive rates and benefits. It is only when they feel ignored, uncared for, and disregarded that money becomes a major issue to express their dissatisfaction. ??? Delegating too much to divisions???for companies with plants scattered around the country, unionizing one or more plants tends to lead to unionizing others. Dealing effectively with unions???monitoring employee's attitudes, reacting properly when the union appears, and so on??? generally requires centralized guidance from the main office and its human resources staff.",

                "answer": "The five basic steps include 1) make initial contact, 2) obtain authorization cards, 3) hold a hearing, 4) hold a campaign, and 5) hold an election. In the initial contact stage, the union determines the employees' interest in organizing and establishes an organizing committee. In step two, the union organizers try to get the employees to sign authorization cards to authorize the union to seek a representation election and state that the employee has applied to join the union. Thirty percent of the eligible employees in an appropriate bargaining unit must sign before the union can petition the National Labor Review Board for an election. Once the union collects the authorization cards, it enters the third stage. In this stage, three things can occur. First, the employer may choose not to contest union recognition and the parties need no hearing. A special consent election is held. Second, the employer may choose to recognize the union's right to an election and the parties can immediately stipulate an election. Third, the employer may choose to contest the union's right and insist on a hearing to determine those issues. If a hearing is held and the results of the hearing are favorable for the union, the NLRB will order holding an election. In the fourth stage, a campaign will be held for the respective employer and union to appeal to employees for their votes. The election is held within 30-60 days after the NLRB issues its Decision and Direction of Election. The election is by secret ballot. The union wins if it gets a majority of the votes cast.",

A fact finder is a neutral party who studies the issues in a dispute and makes a public recommendation for a reasonable settlement. This is commonly used in national emergency disputes. Arbitration offers the arbitrator the power to determine and dictate the settlement terms. If the arbitration is binding, both parties are committed to accepting the decision of the arbitrator.",

Unions call unfair labor practice strikes to protest illegal conduct by the employer. A wildcat strike is an unauthorized strike occurring during the term of a contract. A sympathy strike occurs when one union strikes in support of the strike of another union. Picketing, or having employees carry signs announcing their concerns near the employer's place of business, is one of the first activities to occur during a strike.

                "answer": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created to protect workers and minimize workplace accidents. OSHA's basic purpose is to administer the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and to set and enforce the safety and health standards that apply to almost all workers in the United States. The Department of Labor enforces the standards, and OSHA has inspectors working out of branch offices to ensure compliance. Under OSHA, employers with 11 or more employees must maintain records of and report certain occupational injuries and occupational illnesses. OSHA enforces its standards through inspections and (if necessary) citations. The inspection is usually unannounced. OSHA may not conduct warrantless inspections without an employer's consent. It may inspect with an authorized search warrant or its equivalent. OSHA takes a \"worst-first\" approach in setting inspection priorities. Priorities include, from highest to lowest, imminent dangers, catastrophes and fatal accidents, employee complaints, high-hazard industries inspections, and follow-up inspections. In one recent year, OSHA conducted about 40,600 inspections, and accepted more than 3,000 whistle-blower cases.",

Hazardous procedures in, on, or around machines or equipment ??? Unsafe storage???congestion, overloading ??? Improper illumination???glare, insufficient light ??? Improper ventilation???insufficient air change, impure air source The solution here is to identify and eliminate the unsafe conditions. The main aim of the OSHA standards is to address these mechanical and physical accident-causing conditions. OSHA enforces its standards through inspections and (if necessary) citations. The inspection is usually unannounced. OSHA may not conduct warrantless inspections without an employer's consent. However, it may inspect after acquiring an authorized search warrant or its equivalent. With a limited number of inspectors, OSHA recently has focused on \"fair and effective enforcement,\" combined with outreach, education and compliance assistance, and various OSHA-employer cooperative programs.",

A student's hair or clothing could become caught in the lathe, a rotating object that \"catches\" it and pulls it into the machine. What are the consequences? The student could receive a severe injury as his or her body part or hair is caught and drawn into the spinning lathe. How could it happen? The accident could happen as a result of the student leaning too close to the lathe while working at the bench, or walking too close to the lathe, or bending to reach for an article that fell close to the lathe. What are other contributing factors? Speed is one contributing factor. The problem would occur so quickly that the student would be unable to take evasive action once the lathe ensnarled the hair.",

Doing so typically involves conducting plant/facility walk-around surveys, employee interviews, records reviews, and reviews of government and nongovernmental standards regarding various occupational exposure hazards. Then, the evaluation phase involves determining how severe the hazard is. This usually requires measuring the exposure, comparing the measured exposure to some benchmark and determining whether the risk is acceptable.

Strategy risks are risks that managers accept as part of executing their strategies, such as the risk a banker takes that a borrower defaults. Employers manage some strategy risks with independent experts (like those who assess insurance risks) and with internal experts, like the risk managers who help to oversee banks' loan portfolios.

Interior security, including possible need for key cards, secure restrooms, and better identification of exits; 3. Authorities' involvement, in particular emergency procedures developed with local law enforcement authorities; 4. Mail handling, including how employees screen and open mail and where it enters the building; 5. Evacuation, including a full review of evacuation procedures and training; and 6. Backup systems, for instance, that let the company store data off site if disaster strikes. Having assessed the potential current level of risk, the employer then turns its attention to assessing and improving natural, mechanical, and organizational security. Natural security means taking advantage of the facility's natural or architectural features in order to minimize security problems. Mechanical security is the utilization of security systems such as locks, intrusion alarms, access control systems, and surveillance systems to reduce the need for continuous human surveillance.

Multinationals also view a successful stint abroad as a required step in developing top managers. Furthermore, the assumption is that home-country managers are already steeped in the firm's policies and culture, and thus more likely to apply headquarters' ways of doing things. Posting expatriates abroad is expensive, security problems give potential expatriates' pause, returning expatriates often leave for other employers within a year or two, and educational facilities are turning out top-quality candidates abroad. Systematizing the entire expatriate management process is one way to avoid such early returns. For example, employers should have an expatriate policy covering matters such as compensation and travel costs. Include procedures, for instance, requiring that the manager responsible for the expat's costs obtain all chain of command approvals. Another step in avoiding early returns is to test and select people who have the necessary traits and adaptability (as discussed earlier). And perhaps most importantly consider the expat's family situation. In one study, U.S. managers listed, in descending order of importance, reasons for expatriates leaving early: inability of spouse to adjust, managers' inability to adjust, other family problems, managers' personal or emotional immaturity, and inability to cope with larger overseas responsibility. Such findings underscore a truism about selecting international assignees: The problem is usually not incompetence, but family and personal problems.",

The main challenges virtual teams face are often people related. Challenges include building trust, cohesion, and team identity, and overcoming the isolation among team members. Success therefore depends on human resource management actions. In particular, train virtual team members in leadership, conflict management, and meetings management, and to respond swiftly to virtual teammates. Be scrupulous about answering e-mails and being positive. Select virtual team members using behavioral and situational interviews, where they describe how they'd respond to illustrative virtual team situations. Use current virtual team members to help recruit and select new team members.",

Next, step back and ask how you want each pay component (salary, bonus, incentives, and so forth) to contribute to prompting those executive actions. Step 4. Identify gaps. Next, ask, \"To what extent do our pay plans around the world now support these actions, and what changes if any are required?\" Step 5. Systematize pay systems. Next, create more consistent performance assessment practices, and establish consistent job requirements and performance expectations for similar jobs worldwide. Step 6. Adapt pay policies. Finally, review your global pay policies (for setting salary levels, incentives, and so forth). Conduct surveys and analyses to assess local pay practices. Then fine- tune the firm's global pay policies so they make sense for each location.",

                "question": "How does HR management differ in small and large firms?",
                "answer": "Managing human resources in small firms is different for four main reasons: size, priorities, informality, and the nature of the entrepreneur. Few small firms have a dedicated human resource management professional. The priorities of a small firm are focused less on HR and more on financing, production, and marketing. HR management activities tend to be more informal in smaller firms. Such informality isn't just due to a lack of expertise and resources; it's also partly a \"matter of survival.\" Entrepreneurs must be able to react quickly to changes in competitive conditions. Very small employers (say, with ten employees or less) will probably start with a manual human resource management system. From a practical point of view, this generally means obtaining and organizing a set of standardized personnel forms covering each important aspect of HR???recruitment, selection, training, appraisal, compensation, safety process???as well as some means for organizing all this information for each of your employees. As the small business grows, it becomes increasingly unwieldy and uncompetitive to rely on manual HR systems. For a company with 40 or 50 employees or more, the amount of management time devoted to things like attendance history and performance appraisals can multiply into weeks. It is therefore at about this point that most small- to medium-sized firms begin computerizing individual human resource management tasks.",

                "answer": "The smaller firm is probably not adequately addressing potential workplace litigation. Most small business owners are well aware of the threat of employment related litigation. However, their size and lack of HR expertise makes it unlikely that they'll address the problem. For example, most don't provide adequate (or any) employment discrimination or sexual harassment training. The small business owner may not be fully complying with compensation regulations and laws, such as paying compensatory time for overtime hours worked, and distinguishing between employees and independent contractors. Violations have serious consequences. Many government tools are available to small businesses. The U.S. Department of Labor's \"FirstStep Employment Law Advisor\" helps small employers determine which laws apply to their business. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) administers Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA). Its Web site contains important information and practical advice regarding EEOC matters. The DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration site similarly supplies guidance for small business owners. This contains practical information for small business owners, including industry-specific safety and accident checklists.",

For example, the Department of Labor's O*NET enables business owners to quickly create accurate and professional job descriptions and job specifications. Small business owners can use online recruiting tools like Internet job boards to post positions. For businesses with their own company Web sites, the dot-jobs domain can be effective. Although small companies can't compete with the training resources of giants like GE, Internet training can provide, at a relatively low cost, the sort of professional employee training that was formerly beyond most small employers' reach. We've seen that even small employers now have easy access to computerized and online appraisal and compensation services. For example, small employers can contract with vendors that enable them to do performance appraisals online.",

                "answer": "For the small business, one or two hiring mistakes could wreak havoc. Some tests are so easy to use they are particularly good for smaller firms. One is the Wonderlic Personnel Test, which measures general mental ability. With questions somewhat similar to the SAT, it takes less than 15 minutes to administer the 4-page booklet. Comparing the person's score with the minimum scores recommended for various occupations shows whether the person achieved the minimally acceptable score for the type of job in question. The Predictive Index measures work- related personality traits, drives, and behaviors???in particular dominance, extroversion, patience, and blame avoidance???on a two-sided sheet. A template makes scoring simple. The Predictive Index program includes 15 standard benchmark personality patterns. Both tests are available in online versions. Online arrangements like these have many benefits, beyond just saving the time the owners' employees might have to spend testing employees. For example, because it's available 24/7, prospective candidates can log in and apply anytime, wherever they are. That means a larger potential pool of applicants, and hopefully more likelihood of getting an outstanding employee. There are low-tech and costless things a small business can do to improve its selection process, such as work sampling tests.",

                "answer": "A lack of attention and expertise regarding HR means that most small businesses face certain risks. First, small business owners run the risk that their relatively rudimentary human resource practices will put them at a competitive disadvantage. Second, there is a lack of specialized HR expertise. In most larger small businesses, there are at most one or two dedicated human resource management people responsible for the full range of HR functions, from recruitment to compensation and safety. This makes it more likely that they'll miss problems in specific areas. Third, the smaller firm is probably not adequately addressing potential workplace litigation. Fourth, the small business owner may not be fully complying with compensation regulations and laws. Fifth, duplication in paperwork leads to inefficiencies and data entry errors. A professional employer organization (PEO) can minimize risks for small firms. These vendors range from payroll companies to those that handle all an employer's human resource management requirements, such as paperwork, benefits, and legal compliance.",

                "answer": "Small business managers need to choose and manage the PEO relationship carefully. You should conduct a needs analysis so that you'll know ahead of time exactly what human resource and risk management concerns your company wants to address. You should review the services of all PEO firms you're considering and determine if the PEO is accredited. Check the provider's bank, credit, and professional references. Make sure to demand specifics on things like insurance providers and creditors. Understand how the employee benefits are funded. Is it fully insured or partially self-funded? Who is the third-party administrator or carrier? Confirm the participating employers will receive first-day coverage. See if the provider contract assumes the employment law compliance liabilities in the applicable states. Review the service agreement carefully. Investigate how long the PEO has been in business. The vendor should show a history of staying power to show that it's well-managed. Check out the prospective PEO's staff. Periodically get proof that payroll taxes and insurance premiums are being paid properly and that any legal issues are handled correctly.",

                "answer": "Very small employers (say, with ten employees or less) will probably start with a manual human resource management system. From a practical point of view, this generally means obtaining and organizing a set of standardized personnel forms covering each important aspect of HR???recruitment, selection, training, appraisal, compensation, safety process???as well as some means for organizing all this information for each of your employees. As the small business grows, it becomes increasingly unwieldy and uncompetitive to rely on manual HR systems. For a company with 40 or 50 employees or more, the amount of management time devoted to things like attendance history and performance appraisals can multiply into weeks. It is therefore at about this point that most small- to medium-sized firms begin computerizing individual human resource management tasks. An integrated human resource information system (HRIS) has interrelated components working together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of an organization's human resource management activities. Packaged systems provide software solutions for virtually all personnel tasks, ranging from benefits management to compensation, compliance, employee relations, payroll, and time and attendance systems. Software is available for controlling attendance, employee record keeping, writing job descriptions, writing employee handbooks, and conducting computerized employee appraisals. Most systems enable management to produce standard reports on matters such as attendance, benefits, and ethnic information.",
